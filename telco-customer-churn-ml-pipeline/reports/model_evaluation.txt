PRIMARY MODEL: Random Forest Classifier
REASON: Best overall performance across all metrics
  - Highest accuracy (81.56%)
  - Best recall for identifying churners (59.73%)
  - Superior ROC-AUC score (85.17%)
  - Better captures complex patterns in customer behavior

Selected Model: Random Forest
  - n_estimators: 200

PRODUCTION METRICS & EXPECTATIONS
================================================================================

Expected Model Accuracy in Production: ~79-82%
Expected Precision: ~67-72%
Expected Recall: ~55-62%
Expected ROC-AUC: ~0.83-0.86

Business Impact:
  - For every 100 actual churners: Model identifies ~60 (Recall: 59.73%)
  - Among predicted churners: ~69 are true positives (Precision: 69.48%)
  - Overall, ~82 out of 100 customers correctly classified

Cost-Benefit Analysis:
  - True Positive (Correct churn prediction): Apply retention strategy
  - False Positive (Predicted churn, won't churn): Benign retention offer
  - True Negative (Correct non-churn): No action needed
  - False Negative (Missed churn, will churn): Lost customer

Recommended Retention Strategy:
  - Target customers with churn probability > 60%
  - Prioritize high-value customers with churn risk
  - Allocate retention budget based on risk scores

================================================================================
MODEL LIMITATIONS & CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

1. Class Imbalance Effects:
   - 26.5% churn rate (slightly imbalanced)
   - Model may favor majority class
   - Consider using class weights in future iterations

2. Temporal Aspects:
   - Model assumes stationary distribution
   - Seasonal churn patterns not captured
   - Recommend periodic retraining (quarterly)

3. Feature Engineering Opportunities:
   - Customer interaction history not included
   - Service quality metrics absent
   - Competitor offerings not considered
   - Historical churn patterns not captured

4. Model Drift:
   - Monitor performance metrics in production
   - Set alert thresholds for accuracy drop
   - Plan for regular model retraining

5. Ethical Considerations:
   - Ensure predictions don't discriminate on protected attributes
   - Be transparent about model predictions
   - Use predictions to improve service, not punish customers
